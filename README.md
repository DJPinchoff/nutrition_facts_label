## Project Description

Given the following link:
http://d3jtzah944tvom.cloudfront.net/lesson_5/nutrition_facts_label/label.html

I was tasked to recreate the link using only HTML and CSS. I was given the challenge of only using one class. This was to practice using complex/advanced CSS selectors as well as specificity as it relates to the cascading weight of rules in CSS, all while keeping the HTML very semantic and specific aligned with the content.
